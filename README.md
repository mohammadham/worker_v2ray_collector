## 1. Overview
The **VPN Config Bot Pro** is a Cloudflare Worker that acts as a Telegram bot to automatically collect, test, rate, and redistribute VPN configuration links (VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks). It includes a complete web‑based admin dashboard, a voting system, submission approval workflows, scheduled cleanup, and rate‑limited Telegram API calls. All persistent data is stored in Cloudflare KV.

---

## 2. Feature List

### Core Automation
- **Config Extraction** – Scrapes plain text from configured URLs and extracts all VPN configs using regex patterns.
- **Protocol Support** – Recognises `vless://`, `vmess://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`.
- **Health Testing** – Tests each config via DNS-over-HTTPS (Cloudflare) and TCP `HEAD` requests; reports status (`active`, `dns_only`, `dead`) and latency.
- **Automatic Distribution** – Sends newly discovered, tested configs to one or more Telegram channels.
- **Scheduled Execution** – Uses Worker’s `scheduled` event to run fetch and cleanup every minute (configurable).

### User Interaction (Telegram)
- **Start Menu** – Different menus for regular users and admin.
- **Submit Configs** – Users can send raw configs; submissions go into a pending queue.
- **Voting** – Like/dislike buttons on each published config; scores are stored per user.
- **Latest & Best Rated** – Retrieve newest or top‑scored configs.
- **Stats** – View total configs, active count, total likes.
- **Copy & Share** – Buttons to copy config or share via Telegram.

### Admin Operations (Telegram & Dashboard)
- **Manage Source Links** – Add/remove URLs that are polled for new configs.
- **Manage Channels** – Add/remove destination Telegram channels.
- **Submissions Approval** – View pending submissions, approve/reject, and auto‑publish to channels.
- **Templates** – Customise message templates per protocol.
- **Settings** – Adjust cleanup thresholds, rate limits, retention days, etc.
- **Manual Triggers** – `/check`, `/cleanup`, and admin menu buttons for immediate execution.
- **Dashboard** – Full web‑based control panel with authentication.

### Web Dashboard
- **Login** – Basic authentication (static credentials from env vars).
- **Statistics Cards** – Total configs, active, links, channels, pending, votes.
- **Tabbed Interface** – Manage links, channels, configs, templates, submissions, settings, actions.
- **Configs View** – Paginated, sortable (newest, best, latency, active), delete configs, vote simulation.
- **Template Editor** – Edit message templates per protocol, set active template.
- **Settings Editor** – Modify all numeric/boolean settings via form.
- **Action Buttons** – Fetch now, cleanup, retest all, test single config.
- **Responsive Design** – Mobile‑friendly, dark theme, glassmorphism UI.

### Data Management & Persistence
- **KV Storage** – Uses Cloudflare KV for all dynamic data: config cache, stored configs, votes, submissions, templates, settings, links, channels.
- **Local KV Cache** – In‑memory cache with 5‑second TTL to reduce KV reads.
- **Cleanup Logic** – Automatic deletion based on:
  - Age without likes (`autoDeleteDays`)
  - Stale test results (`staleDeleteDays`)
  - Excessive consecutive failed tests (`maxFailedTests`)
- **Concurrency Control** – Limits parallel operations (test, Telegram sends) to avoid overload.

### Resilience & Performance
- **Rate Limiter** – Custom `RateLimiter` class to respect Telegram’s 30 messages/second limit, with retry on 429.
- **Promise Limiting** – `promiseAllWithLimit` restricts concurrent tests and Telegram sends.
- **Error Handling** – Graceful degradation; failed fetches/sends are logged but do not crash the worker.
- **Retry Logic** – On 429 (rate limit), retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

### Additional Features
- **Redirect Mode** – Option to redirect the root path (`/`) to a custom URL instead of showing the portfolio page.
- **Portfolio Page** – Professional landing page describing the service, with links to dashboard and bot.
- **Set Webhook Endpoint** – Helper endpoint to configure Telegram webhook.
- **CORS Headers** – Enabled for dashboard API.

**Key Flows**:
1. **Automatic Fetch** – Cron runs `checkAndDistribute()`: fetches source links, extracts new configs, tests them, stores results, and sends active ones to channels.
2. **User Submission** – User sends config or presses “Submit” button; worker stores submission as pending in KV.
3. **Admin Approval** – Admin approves via callback or dashboard; config is tested, formatted, and published to channels.
4. **Voting** – User clicks like/dislike; vote is recorded; message is edited to reflect new score.
5. **Dashboard** – Admin logs in, views/manages all resources via REST API backed by KV.

## 4. Operational Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fully Automatic Mode
- Admin configures several source URLs (e.g., GitHub raw config lists) and one or more output Telegram channels.
- Worker runs every minute: fetches new configs, tests them, and automatically posts **only the ones that pass** to the channels.
- No manual intervention required.

### Scenario 2: Community Submission + Approval
- Users discover the bot, press “Submit Config” and paste their config.
- Admin receives notification (via menu) and can approve/reject each submission.
- Approved configs are tested and published to channels, credited with the submitter’s username.

### Scenario 3: Rating & Curation
- Subscribers in channels see like/dislike buttons under each config.
- High‑rated configs appear in the “Best Rated” command.
- Admin can set `minLikesToKeep` so that popular configs are not auto‑deleted even if they are old.

### Scenario 4: Dashboard Management
- Admin visits `/dashboard`, logs in, and monitors system health.
- Adds/removes source links, channels, edits templates, adjusts cleanup thresholds.
- Manually triggers a fetch or cleanup run.
- Deletes problematic configs directly from the dashboard.

## 5. Complete Documentation

### 5.1 Setup & Deployment
1. **Create a Cloudflare Worker** – Use the dashboard or Wrangler CLI.
2. **Bind a KV Namespace** – Name it `VPN_CACHE` (must match variable name in code).
3. **Set Environment Variables** (secrets) – See section 5.2.
4. **Upload the Worker script** – Copy the entire `worker.js` content.
5. **Configure Trigger** – Add a Cron trigger (e.g., `* * * * *`) for scheduled tasks.
6. **Set Webhook** – Send a GET request to `https://your-worker.workers.dev/set-webhook` (this will call Telegram `setWebhook` with the worker’s URL).

### 5.2 Environment Variables (Secrets)
| Variable          | Description                                                                 |

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses

### ✅ Strengths
- **All‑in‑one** – Combines scraping, testing, publishing, voting, and admin UI in a single worker.
- **Cost‑effective** – Runs entirely on Cloudflare’s free tier (KV, Workers).
- **Scalable** – Uses concurrency limiting and KV caching; can handle hundreds of configs.
- **Customizable** – Templates, settings, redirect mode make it adaptable.
- **Good UX** – Inline keyboards, real‑time vote updates, clean dashboard.
- **Resilient** – Rate limiting, retries, error catching prevent crashes.
- **Portfolio page** – Professional public face.

### ❌ Weaknesses & Limitations

1. **Config Testing Reliability**
   - Only tests TCP port reachability via `HEAD` request – not a true VPN protocol handshake.
   - Uses Cloudflare DoH – may be blocked in some regions or count toward DoH limits.
   - No support for UDP or advanced protocol‑specific checks.
   - Latency measurement may be inflated due to Cloudflare proxy.

2. **Config Parsing**
   - Regex extraction is fragile; embedded newlines or unusual formatting may fail.
   - VMess base64 decoding assumes specific JSON structure; malformed configs crash silently.
   - Does not support `ss://` with SIP002 format (no `@` delimiter) or `vless://` with extra query parameters.

3. **Security**
   - Dashboard uses hard‑coded credentials (no 2FA, session management only via self‑encoded JWT-like token).
   - No CSRF protection; token stored in localStorage.
   - Admin chat ID is used as sole identifier – if compromised, attacker gains full admin control.
   - Submissions contain raw configs with possible personal remarks (remarks may reveal server owner).

4. **KV & Performance**
   - `kvGet`/`kvSet` are called frequently; local cache helps but only 5s TTL.
   - Large config lists (500+) may hit KV read/write limits or cause slow responses.
   - No pagination for `stored_configs` in memory – entire list loaded on each operation.

5. **Error Handling Gaps**
   - Many `try/catch` blocks are empty or just `console.error`; some failures are ignored (e.g., DNS test).
   - `testConfig` may throw unhandled exceptions from `fetch` if signal times out – not fully caught.
   - No logging or monitoring integration.

6. **Bot Interaction**
   - `/start` overwrites user state; if user is in “awaiting_config”, `/start` will exit that state without confirmation.
   - Callback queries are answered with “Processing…” but sometimes the edit fails silently.
   - No feedback when user tries to vote on a config that was already deleted.

7. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Relies on environment variables for secrets; no built‑in setup wizard.
   - Admin must manually set webhook via `/set-webhook` endpoint.

8. **Protocol Limitations**
   - Only supports four protocols; no WireGuard, OpenVPN, etc.
   - No support for configs with `&` in parameters (query string split may fail).

## 7. Areas for Improvement & Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Immediate Bug Fixes
1. **VMess Parsing** – In `extractServer`, `atob` may fail on non‑base64 strings; wrap in `try/catch` and fallback.
2. **`testConfig` timeout** – `AbortSignal.timeout` is not supported in all Workers environments; use `AbortController` with `setTimeout`.
3. **`sendTelegram` rate limiter** – The limiter is created once per worker instance; but multiple instances may exist, causing bursts. Use a Durable Object or external rate limiting for accuracy.
4. **`kvGet` default handling** – Some calls pass `[]` as default but the stored value might be `null`; ensure consistent type.
5. **`cleanupConfigs`** – `daysSinceTest` uses `lastTest` but if test_result is missing, it compares `undefined` and `NaN`. Add guard.
6. **`handleCallback` – when editing message after vote, the bot token is not included in the `fetch` URL; it uses `telegramApi(env.BOT_TOKEN)` correctly? Yes, but `fetch` inside callback uses `telegramApi(env.BOT_TOKEN)` – however, `env` is not in scope there. Actually the code uses `telegramApi(env.BOT_TOKEN)` inside the `fetch` call – this works because `env` is passed to `handleCallback`. No bug, but ensure `env` is defined.

### ⚙️ Performance & Reliability
- **Implement proper pagination in `stored_configs`** – Keep all configs in KV as a list of keys, not a single large array. Currently, the whole array is read/written each time, which will hit KV 1MB limit and slow performance.
- **Use KV expiration** – Instead of manual cleanup, set TTL on KV entries for votes/configs.
- **Parallel test limiting** – `promiseAllWithLimit` is used only in retest-all; apply it in `checkAndDistribute` as well.
- **Improve caching** – Increase cache TTL for static data (templates, settings). Use `cache-control` for source URL fetches.

### 🛡️ Security Enhancements
- **Dashboard authentication** – Replace simple token with proper session management (e.g., JWT with short expiry, secure cookie).
- **Add CSRF token** for dashboard API POST requests.
- **Rate limit login attempts** – Prevent brute force.
- **Admin action confirmation** – Require second confirmation for deletion of configs/links.
- **Sanitise config remarks** – Strip potentially offensive text before publishing.

### 🧪 Testing Accuracy
- **Use protocol‑specific probes** – For VMess/VLESS, attempt a real handshake (maybe via external service) or at least measure TLS handshake time.
- **Add fallback DNS** – If Cloudflare DoH is unavailable, try Google or system DNS.
- **Test multiple ports** – Some configs use non‑standard ports; verify both 443 and the specified port.

### 📱 User Experience
- **Add “Report” button** – Allow users to report dead or malicious configs.
- **Show submitter name** on approved configs (optional).
- **Add inline search** – Search configs by remark, IP, or protocol.
- **Persistent user state** – Use conversation handler to avoid state loss.

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Integrate with Cloudflare Logpush** or send logs to a webhook.
- **Track daily active users, votes, submissions** – Store aggregated stats in KV.
- **Alert admin** when many configs fail test or when source URLs are down.

## 8. Proposed Feature Enhancements

### 🚀 High‑Impact Additions
1. **Multi‑protocol Support**
   - Add WireGuard (`wg://`), OpenVPN (`.ovpn`), IKEv2, etc.
   - Parse base64‑encoded OpenVPN profiles.

2. **Geo‑location Tagging**
   - Resolve server IP to country/city using MaxMind or ip-api, display flag in message.

3. **Automatic Channel Post Scheduling**
   - Instead of posting immediately, queue configs and post at intervals to avoid channel flooding.

4. **User Favourites**
   - Allow users to “bookmark” configs; send notification when a favourited config goes offline.

5. **Config Quality Score**
   - Combine latency, uptime, vote score, and age into a single quality score.

6. **Dark Web / Alternative Fetch**
   - Support fetching from IPFS, Tor, or Telegram channels (via MTProto).

7. **Multi‑Admin Support**
   - Allow multiple admin chat IDs with different permission levels.

8. **Backup & Restore**
   - Export/import all KV data via dashboard.

9. **Internationalisation (i18n)**
   - Support multiple languages in bot messages.

10. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**
    - Graphs of active configs over time, vote trends, etc. using Chart.js.

### 🧩 Nice‑to‑Have
- **Config Shortener** – Generate tiny URLs for long configs.
- **QR Code** – Generate QR for easy mobile scan (in dashboard).
- **REST API** for third‑party integration.
- **Subscription via RSS** – Users can subscribe to config feeds.
- **Auto‑remove low‑score configs** – Delete if dislike count exceeds likes by threshold.
